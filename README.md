# CASE-STUDY-ILEARN-A-DIGITAL-LEARNING-ENVIRONMENT
The iLearn system is a digital learning environment used to support learning in schools with students from age 4 to 18. It is intended to replace an existing system (Glow) that was specially built for the purpose and which includes its own applications for e-mail, etc. It became less and less used as the facilities in freely available systems were far superior to those offered in the closed system. One of the most important requirements for the iLearn system was that it should be an open system that could easily accommodate new features and existing services. We aimed to achieve this by designing the system so that everything was a service and that, with appropriate permissions, users could replace pre-specified services with their own service version. This approach also allowed us to deal with the complexity of integrating with existing network management systems (local areas had different policies on which web sites could be visited by school students, depending on age and content) and school administration systems. By creating a service interface to these systems, different underlying systems could be accommodated.
